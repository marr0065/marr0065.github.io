<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Owen Marriner, and I am a Interactive Media Design Student. In my spare time I enjoy playing a variety of sports. Mostly volleyball and rock climbing. I have been a rock climber for about 13 years and formerly did it professionally. I have climbed all over the world, and even competed at youth Pan American Games. My current passion is coaching the younger generation of climbing athletes. My team this year has been very motivated and eager to learn, even having a few athletes selected to represent Canada at the Youth World Cup this year in Shanghai. I have never been so I am very excited!</p>
<p>I am a returning student, This is my 3<sup>rd</sup> program. Having previously been in the Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology program and the Business administration program. I did not suceed or enjoy either program, and I think <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> will be a good fit for me. I enjoy being creative in everything I do, so I am very happy with all of the courses this semester, and am looking forward to future semesters. </p>
